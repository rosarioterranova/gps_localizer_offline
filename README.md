##Description
This app will allow you to acquire, at any time and without the need to connect, the GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees DD) of the point where you are and to share them with your friends via SMS or email.  In addition, you can see on the map the coordinates received by someone else (you must have downloaded the map of the area you want to display with Nokia Here Maps).  All without connection!
